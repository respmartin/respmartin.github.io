        <div class="col-lg-8 pt-4 pt-lg-0 content">
          <p>I grew up in Granada, in the south of Spain &mdash; a city of medieval palaces, flamenco echoing off stone walls, and, most importantly, Real Madrid on TV every weekend. From an early age I was drawn to how systems work: radio signals, antennas, the invisible architecture beneath modern communication. That curiosity carried me through a BS and MS in Telecommunications Engineering at the Universidad de Granada, then &mdash; after winning the La Caixa fellowship, one of Spain&rsquo;s most prestigious academic grants &mdash; across the Atlantic to UC San Diego for a second MS in Electrical and Computer Engineering.</p>

          <p>I have spent 15+ years building and verifying the scientific software that engineers trust when lives and missions are on the line. At Delcross Technologies in Chicago, I helped develop Savant &mdash; the engine behind HFSS SBR+, Ansys&rsquo;s industry-leading electromagnetic ray-tracing solver. At Ansys, I grew from engineer to technical leader, owning the verification strategy for HFSS: defining quality standards, building testing infrastructure, and making sure one of the world&rsquo;s most complex physics simulators does exactly what it promises. Since 2017, I have called the San Francisco Bay Area home, and in 2025 I joined Synopsys &mdash; the largest EDA company in the world &mdash; as a Sr. Staff Engineer in Verification Engineering.</p>

          <p>Outside the terminal, I pick up my guitar, lace up for a run through the hills, lose myself in a novel, or try out a new recipe from whatever corner of the world is currently calling to me. I still catch every Real Madrid match I can. Some things do not change.</p>

                Rebecca is a very bright person. It was a pleasure to supervise someone who was not only
                enthusiastic but also very quick to take up new ideas. She demonstrated to be a very good
                researcher and produced work of very high quality, exceeding all the objectives set for her.

                I enjoyed teaching Rebecca in two undergraduate courses, Computer Architecture and
                Parallel Architecture. She had an excellent academic record in both classes and was
                an eager and informed participant in class as well. I am confident that

                Ms. Rebecca Martin distinguished herself as one of the most eminent students in her class,
                obtaining maximum grades and always showing a positive attitude towards the courses and all
                related activities. She opted to carry on advanced laboratory projects, cooperating with
